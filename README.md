# Jasmine Testing Suite

[LIVE PREVIEW](https://seanvonb.github.io/jasmine-tests/)

The purpose of this project was to practice writing Jasmine tests for a premade feed reader site. It was a good introduction to testing on the front end in real time. Unfortunately, years later, the project has aged: the original loader for the chart API isn't supported anymore, and I don't know whether using IIFEs is still the best practice for running functions after the DOM loads – but I'm proud to have reached this developer milestone of having outdated junk in my portfolio.
