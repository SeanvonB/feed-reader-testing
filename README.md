# Feed Reader Testing Suite

This was my submission for a Jasmine project that was part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of the project was to demonstrate an understanding of how to write tests using the Jasmine testing framework for a pre-made webpage; for instance, does the menu properly toggle its show/hide state when clicked, or does the content change between feeds as expected?

This spec file uses an IIFE to run when the page is first loaded and displays the results at the bottom of the page â€“ nothing else is required, and tests will continue to check and re-check automatically throughout development.

To check it out, simply download the files, unzip them, and open <i>index.html</i> with your browser.
